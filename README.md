# Pi-In-the-Sky

## Spin-Copter

### Planning
#### Goal 
For this project we need to get a Pi into the Sky. The payload must survive and function post-flight. We also need to collect data throughout the flight and save that data to the Picoâ€™s onboard storage. For our project we decided to make a spin copter. We would record the wind speed and shoot the copter into the sky and it would record the height and amount of time it takes to fall back down. We would then see how wind speed affected the height and time it takes for the copter to reach the ground.
